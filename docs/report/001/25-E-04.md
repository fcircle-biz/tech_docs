Abstract
This  paper  examines  the  relationship  between  individuals’  expectations  of  job
replacement by generative AI (GenAI) and their macroeconomic outlooks and behaviors.
Using online surveys combined with randomized experiments conducted in the U.S. and
Japan,  we  derive  the  following  findings  about  the  effects  of  expecting  greater  job
replacement  due  to  GenAI.  First,  in  both  the  U.S.  and  Japan,  respondents  revise  their
beliefs  after  receiving  information  about  GenAI’s  job  replacement  ratios.  Second,  in
Japan, such an expectation leads to an increase in inflation expectations driven by a rise
in investment. Third, it increases respondents’ willingness to use GenAI in workplaces in
Japan. Fourth, in the U.S., expectations of greater job replacement amplify concerns about
weaker short-term labor demand and reduced skill requirements, particularly among more
educated respondents. In addition, these respondents anticipate lower investment, while
less educated respondents expect higher investment.

Introduction

“The best way to predict the future is to invent it.”

— Alan Kay

The rapid advances in generative AI (GenAI) have sparked significant interest and prompted

widespread speculation about its transformative potential. However, the high level of un-

certainty surrounding GenAI has fueled ongoing debate about its economic impact. This
discussion becomes especially heated when it concerns AI’s effect on the labor market.

This intense debate shapes public expectations about AI’s impact on the economy. As

recent studies on the role of expectations suggest, these perceptions can influence actual
behavior, which in turn affects economic outlooks. For example, positive views on AI’s

impact can encourage its adoption, further boosting productivity and investment. Con-

versely, negative perspectives may hinder AI’s use and learning, potentially resulting in
smaller effects on the economy. As the importance of expectations about AI’s impact is

well recognized, many surveys have been conducted focusing on people’s views regard-

ing AI’s impact on the labor market. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no

studies examining the role of expectations about AI in shaping people’s economic outlook

and behavior.

To address this gap, we conducted a survey on perceptions of AI’s effect on the labor

market, along with randomized experiments in the United States and Japan. Specifically,

we divided respondents into two treatment groups. The first group was provided with

information from an expert analysis that GenAI would replace 14% of current jobs, while

the second group was informed that AI could replace 47% of jobs based on the estimates

by Briggs and Kodnani (2023) and Frey and Osborne (2017).1 We then asked participants

about their expectations regarding the job replacement ratio before the treatment (referred

to as “prior beliefs”), followed by their updated expectations after the treatment (referred to

as “posterior beliefs”). In addition, respondents were asked to predict economic outcomes,

such as real GDP growth rates over 1-, 3-, and 5-10-year horizons, as well as their intentions

1See Section 3.2 for more detailed discussion on the replacement ratio. We also collect responses from a
third group that received unrelated astronomical information. However, in this paper, we focus on the two
treatment groups, as these treatments reflect realistic situations that people may encounter.

to learn and use AI in the workplace. Using the responses about AI’s impact on the labor
market and views on macroeconomic variables, we identify the causal effect of individuals’

expectations regarding the labor replacement ratio by GenAI on their economic outlooks

and behavior. It is important to note that we do not aim to predict AI’s impact on the

economy or the labor market. Rather, we seek to uncover how changes in views on AI
affect economic expectations and behavior.

Our study sheds light on ongoing debate about the impact of AI on macroeconomic

variables beyond the labor market. In fact, Aldasoro et al. (2024) demonstrate that GenAI

could exert inflationary pressure on the economy in the long run, while in the short
run, it could result in either disinflationary or inflationary effects, depending on how

economic agents form expectations regarding GenAI’s impact. Specifically, if households

and firms anticipate future productivity growth driven by AI, households may increase

consumption, leading to inflationary pressure even in the short run. On the other hand,

if an increase in productivity due to AI is unanticipated, consumption only increases

gradually. Therefore, in the short run, it has a disinflationary impact as the production

capacity expands. Our paper focuses on the impact of people’s views regarding AI on

inflation expectations, rather than assessing which prediction is more plausible.

Using the randomized experiment, we obtain the following findings. First, people’s

views on GenAI’s labor market impact can be updated by expert opinion. In both the

U.S. and Japan, respondents revise their beliefs after receiving information about GenAI’s

job replacement ratios. This updating behavior aligns with the previous literature on

people’s expectation about macroeconomic variables such as recession probabilities and

is consistent with a Bayesian process.

Second, in Japan, higher posterior beliefs about the job replacement ratio lead to higher

inflation expectations. In addition, a high replacement ratio is associated with positive

real GDP growth, particularly among high-income individuals, though this estimate of
the marginal effect is not statistically significant on average. Furthermore, a high replace-

ment expectation leads to higher private investment growth among workers in creative

occupations. We can infer that this result is partly due to their high reliance on many

labor-intensive tasks such as writing text, which are likely to be replaced by GenAI. These

3

results suggest that the investment demand associated with GenAI could contribute to

rising inflation rates. Moreover, respondents in Japan show an increased intention to use

GenAI in their workplace when they adjust their expectations regarding the replacement

ratio to higher levels.

In contrast, in the U.S., we do not find any significant average effect of a higher replace-

ment ratio on inflation expectations. However, the expectation of a higher replacement

ratio leads to an expectation of weaker labor demand in the short term and a decline in the

skills required for the respondent’s current jobs. The impact on the outlook for labor de-

mand is more pronounced among individuals with higher education levels. This suggests
that people with higher education anticipate more negative effects of GenAI on the labor

market, aligning with previous literature on the heterogeneous impacts of AI on labor.

Finally, respondents in the U.S. do not increase their willingness to use or learn GenAI in

their workplace, even though they have changed their views on its impact on their jobs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature

related to this paper. Section 3 explains the data and the setting of the randomized control

trial. Section 4 introduces econometric models by illustrating the identification strategy

and then reports the survey and experiment results. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

2 Literature review

This study is related to four strands of literature. First, we build on the previous studies

on the impact of AIs on labor market, especially when we implement the randomized

experiment. Among many, Frey and Osborne (2017) is a seminal paper and analyzes

the impact of automation on jobs using detailed job descriptions. They find that a large

share of currents jobs are exposed to the automation by computers. Briggs and Kodnani
(2023) discuss the potential of GenAI and their effects on economy, by showing different

scenarios of AI developments and the subsequent impact on the labor market. We also use

their estimates in the randomized experiments. Webb (2019) uses patent data to identify
which task would be most affected by automation with AI. A growing number of studies

analyze the relationship between labor market and AI including Manyika et al. (2017),

4

Hui et al. (2023), Felten et al. (2021) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020).2 Babina et al.

(2023) find that companies with a larger initial proportion of more educated workers with

expertise in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics tend to invest more in AI. In

addition, they report that AI investments are associated with a flattening of organizational

hierarchies, with a rise in junior-level employees and a decline in middle-management

and senior positions. Cazzaniga et al. (2024) demonstrate that there are clear trends in

AI exposure: women and college-educated individuals face higher exposure but are also

better positioned to benefit from AI advancements, while older workers may struggle

more to adapt to the new technology. Yang (2022) studies the impact of AI in Taiwan’s

electronics industry for the 2002–2018 period and finds that AI technology is positively

associated with productivity and employment. Hering (2023) uses the online job posting

data and finds that 20% of jobs faces the highest level of potential exposure.

Second, we extend the literature on expectation formations of economic variables.3 In

particular, we follow the experimental setting of Roth and Wohlfart (2020) that study the

relationships between macroeconomic expectations and individual behavior. A growing

body of research studies people’s expectations. For example, Das et al. (2020) examine
the heterogeneity in expectation formation across people with different socioeconomic

statuses. They find that individuals with higher income or education levels tend to be

more optimistic about future macroeconomic developments. Kuchler and Zafar (2019)

explores the relationship between personal experiences and views on the macroeconomy,

finding that individuals who experience unemployment personally become more pes-

simistic about future nationwide unemployment. The extent of this extrapolation is more

pronounced among less sophisticated individuals. Malmendier and Nagel (2011) demon-

strates that past individual experiences play a significant role in explaining risk-taking
behavior. Regarding differences across age groups, Malmendier and Nagel (2016) finds

that in response to inflation surprises, younger people update their expectations more

strongly than older individuals, as recent experiences weigh more heavily in their accu-

mulated lifetime history. However, household expectations about the economy may be

2BIS (2024) comprehensively discusses the impact of AI on the economy including labor market.
3Manski (2018) provides a comprehensive literature review on macroeconomic expectations.

5

biased. In fact, Mian et al. (2023) find that an individual’s expectations for future economic

growth are biased depending on whether her favorable political party controls the White

House, and this bias is not necessarily linked to actual behaviors such as consumption.

This result suggests that further intensive studies on household expectations are needed.

The importance of individual beliefs in financial decision-making is highlighted by Bailey

et al. (2019). We contribute to the literature by focusing on the relationship between views

on AI’s role and macroeconomic conditions.

Third, our study extends existing research on the impact of AI on the labor market

through the use of surveys. Among others, Lane et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive

view of AI’s impact in workplaces, enabling international comparisons. McElheran et al.

(2024) use a survey on businesses to study trends in AI adoption, finding that dynamic

young firms with more educated, experienced, and younger owners have the highest rates

of AI use. We extend this survey approach using a randomized controlled trial.

Finally, our paper sheds light on the differences in views regarding the impact of AI

across countries. In terms of the impact of automation and robotics on the economy, a
different landscape appears between Japan and the U.S. Many studies on the U.S. labor

market, including Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020), demonstrate that robots replace human

labor. On the other hand, Adachi et al. (2024) show that the increase in robot usage

increases employment by raising the productivity and production scale of robot-adopting
industries. Although the reasons for the differing impacts of robotics between the two

countries remain debatable, such experiences may influence their expectations about the
impact of AI, leading to different results. We contribute to this literature by conducting
the same survey in both Japan and the U.S., uncovering differences in the causal effects of

views on AI in shaping macroeconomic outlooks and individual behaviors between the

two countries.

3 Data and setting of randomized experiment

This section describes the survey methodology, sampling strategy, data cleaning processes,

and details of the randomized treatment groups.

6

3.1 Survey methodology

We collected 4,144 responses from both the U.S. and Japan through large-scale internet

survey panels administered by Macromill, Inc., Japan’s leading survey company. Only

full-time employees between the ages of 20 and 59 were invited to participate in the

survey and respondents who appropriately completed it could earn cash or a gift voucher.

The survey was implemented to ensure that the number of respondents was equalized

across gender, age, and job category. More specifically, respondents are categorized into

16 distinct demographic groups based on gender, age (20 to 39 years old and 40 to 59 years

old), and job category (Sales and Administrative, Engineering, Planning and Specialist,

and Creative). We should note that these four job categories are not comprehensive.
However, we focus on them partly to ensure a sufficient number of responses within each

category, and partly because workers in these categories are expected to be highly exposed

to generative AI, according to existing studies such as Chui et al. (2023). The details of

the job categories are summarized in Table A.1 in Appendix A. The survey was conducted

from May 20 to June 3, 2024, for the U.S. participants and from May 20 to May 29, 2024,

for Japanese participants.

3.2 Setting of randomized experiment

We randomly assigned respondents into three groups to evaluate the impact of GenAI

on job replacement. The first group was presented with the following information: “A

well-known study on AI estimates that 14% of current jobs could be replaced by GenAI in

the future.” The second group was informed that “A well-known study on AI estimates

that 47% of current jobs could be replaced by GenAI in the future.”

The replacement ratios of 14% and 47% are based on estimates provided by Briggs

and Kodnani (2023). We should note that Briggs and Kodnani (2023) do not report the

replacement ratio of the labor force by AI per se.

Instead, they estimate the exposure

of the labor force to AI-driven automation across various scenarios, assuming varying

levels of AI development.4 The 14% replacement ratio reflects the lowest estimate in

4Briggs and Kodnani (2023) refer to this estimate as the ”share of full-time equivalent US employment

exposed to automation by AI.”

7

their scenarios, while the 47% figure is based on estimates from Frey and Osborne (2017),

which also suggests that 47% of jobs are exposed to automation. We opted not to use the

term “exposed” as in the original papers because it could be ambiguous and interpreted
differently by respondents. However, we acknowledge certain limitations in our approach.

Specifically, the term ”replaced” may evoke a negative perception of AI, even though

its impact could be positive in many areas, such as increased productivity. Moreover,
respondents familiar with the original research might notice the difference in terminology

and become less engaged in answering subsequent questions. Despite these caveats, our

approach reduces ambiguity and provides a finer understanding of the role of people’s

views on AI. In addition, we did not mention the sources of these estimates in the survey.

This decision was made to avoid introducing bias, as belief in the credibility of data sources

can vary depending on individual characteristics, potentially introducing noise into their

responses. Furthermore, we did not provide respondents with information on a forecast

horizon for the professional estimates, given that the estimates do not specify a time

horizon for AI’s labor market impact. This approach allows us to observe respondents’
own beliefs about when GenAI effects may materialize.

Respondents answered the questions introduced in Section 3.3 both before and after re-

ceiving the treatment information. This design allowed us to measure changes in responses

resulting from the provided information. We focus on results from the two treatment

groups with 14% and 47% job replacement ratio by GenAI, following the methodology of

Roth and Wohlfart (2020).

3.3 Survey questions and definition of variables

We outline the question defining the treatment variable for the causal effect analysis,

followed by the questions defining the outcome variables. Respondents answered each of

these questions both prior to and following the treatment.

To construct the treatment variable, we ask respondents about the share of jobs being

replaced by GenAI in 1, 5, and 10 years. The respondents enter values in percentages for

each horizon. Details of this variable can be found in the first line of Table 1. As to the

outcome variables in the randomized experiment, we ask questions regarding expectations

8

for key macroeconomic variables over different time horizons (1 year, 3 years, and an

average of 5-10 years). Respondents answered questions on Consumer Price Index (CPI),

private investment growth, and real GDP growth both before and after treatment, with

answer choices in 0.5% increments, as shown in rows 2 to 4 of Table 1.

Notes: When asking about macroeconomic variables like CPI, private investment, real GDP, we provide the past values for 2022 and
2023 as reference points. The choices for the questions of macroeconomic variables are in increments of 0.5%, such as +0.5%, +1.0%,
+1.5%, etc., with a maximum of +5.0%. If the respondent wants to choose a value greater than that, they should select the choice
”Increase of more than 5.0%”. Similarly, the minimum is -5.0, and if the respondent wants to choose a value less than that, they should
select the choice ”Decrease of more than 5.0%”.

As additional outcome variables, we also survey respondents about their perspec-

tives on their own jobs, specifically regarding wage growth, skills, labor demand, and

productivity.5 Details of these variables can be found in Table 2.

We also prepared variables for the intention for learning and using GenAI in the

workplace. Details of these variables can be found in Table 3.

5They are asked about the projections of those variables over 1, 3, 5, and 10-year horizons. The 1-, 5-, and

10-year projections are used in this paper.

3.4 Representativeness and data cleaning

To ensure balanced demographic representation, our survey aimed for equal numbers of

respondents across gender, age, and job category. Each group has nearly the same number

of respondents across genders. For age, respondents were asked to specify their age in

5-year increments. We excluded respondents who were under 20 years old and those who

were 60 years old or older. The sample includes an equal number of respondents aged

20–39 and 40–59, ensuring balanced representation across these age groups. Respondents

were asked to choose one of 60 job categories, and we aimed to collect an equal number of

valid responses across four consolidated groups: Sales and Administrative, Engineering,

Planning and Specialist, and Creative. However, we obtained fewer valid responses

from individuals in the Creative job category, resulting in a lower proportion of collected

samples for this group.

We implemented a data cleaning process focused on the treatment variable, or the share

of jobs replaced by GenAI. We exclude extreme responses of 0% or 100% from respondents’

Notes: The question for ”Generative AI learning intention ” allows respondents to select more than one choice, but A1 and A2 cannot
be selected at the same time. For the variable “GenAI learning intention ”, options A3 to A7 are not used. This is because these options
indicate cases where respondents have already learned about generative AI. This variable is used to measure the intention to learn for
respondents who have not yet learned about generative AI, so respondents who have already learned about generative AI are excluded.
For the variable “GenAI use intention ”, option A5 is not used. This is because these options indicate cases where respondents have
already learned about generative AI. This variable is used to measure the intention to use generative AI for respondents who have not
yet used it, so respondents who have already used generative AI are excluded.

beliefs about the GenAI job replacement rates across all time horizons.6 As discussed in

Section 3.2, our analysis focuses on the two treatment groups who received prompts about

a 14% and 47% GenAI job replacement ratio. After excluding outliers, the sample includes

2,399 observations in the U.S. and 1,726 in Japan. Figure 1 presents the final sample size

and the job category share for analysis.

Table 4 presents summary statistics for respondents’ demographics and other charac-

teristics across each treatment arm. The mean values and standard deviations for each

variable show little variation between the treatment groups, suggesting that the random-

ization successfully achieved balance. The average age of respondents in both Japan and

the U.S. was around 40 years old. This is because the survey was designed to include

an equal number of people in the 20–39 age group and the 40–59 age group, and only

included people aged 20–59. The actual number of employed people in Japan aged 40–59

is about 1.4 times higher than the number of people aged 20–39 in 2022 according to Labor
Force Survey conducted by Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan. On

the other hand, the actual number of employed people in the U.S. aged 40–59 is about 95%

of the number of people aged 20–39 in 2022 according to Labor Force Statistics (OECD).

6By excluding responses with 0% or 100%, the sample size decreased by approximately 500 for Japan
and 200 for the U.S. in each treatment group. However, our main results remain consistent even when these
outlier responses are included.

The average wages in the samples are higher than the average wage levels for the whole

country in both Japan and the U.S., partly because the types of jobs in the respondents are

limited.7

Notes: This table shows summary statistics of respondent’s demographic and other characteristics by treatment group. The upper panel
indicates the summary statistics for respondents in Japan and the lower panel for the U.S. The unit of “Income (Million)” in million
yen for Japan and million dollars for the U.S.

7The average annual wage in 2023 is 4.6 million yen in Japan and 65,000 U.S. dollar in the U.S., according

to the National Tax Agency of Japan and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, respectively.

4 Results of randomized experiments

In this section, we first examine how respondents update their beliefs about the job re-
placement ratio after the treatment. We then present the results on the effect of this update

on the outlook for macroeconomic indicators and their behavior.

4.1 Prior Beliefs

Before analyzing the updating of the job replacement ratio, we report basic statistics. In

our sample, respondents’ prior beliefs regarding the labor replacement ratio due to GenAI

show significant variation, with many falling between the professional forecast values of

14% and 47%. The ratio tends to show higher values over a longer horizon. As Figure B.1

and Table B.1 in Appendix B show, the median values for 1-year, 5-year, 10-year ahead are

10%, 20% and 30%, respectively.

As Table B.2 shows, several factors explain the differences in respondents’ prior beliefs,

with education being particularly significant. Higher education is associated with lower

expectations of job replacement by GenAI in both Japan and the U.S. However, income has
a different impact between the two countries. In the U.S., higher income is associated with

a more pessimistic outlook on job replacement, while in Japan, higher income is linked to

lower job replacement beliefs.8.

Another key factor would be the private use of GenAI. In the U.S., those using GenAI

privately tend to have higher prior beliefs about the job replacement ratio, possibly per-

ceiving it as a greater disruptor.

In Japan, however, this correlation is not statistically

significant. Age shows mixed results depending on the specification. In the U.S. multi-

variate regressions, age is positively correlated with job replacement expectations, while
the age-squared term is negative, suggesting diminishing marginal effects as age increases.
The marginal effect eventually turns negative when age exceeds approximately 40, based

on the 1-year-ahead expectations. In Japan, the estimate for age is not statistically signif-

icant. Gender overall shows no significant correlation. However, it is noteworthy that

8Income and education are positively and highly correlated as shown in D.1. Therefore, we mainly focus

on univariate regression results.

14

U.S. women tend to hold a more pessimistic outlook, anticipating higher replacement

rates by GenAI as the time horizon stretches further into the future. Finally, people with

subordinates expect higher replacement rates in 1- and 5-year horizons, though this cor-

relation weakens over 10 years due to increased uncertainty. In Japan, respondents with

repetitive jobs hold higher beliefs about replacement rates although there is no statistically

significant estimate for the correlation with repetitive work in the U.S.

4.2 Updating of replacements by GenAI

We examine whether the provided information leads to a significant shift in expectations

toward the expert projections in the treatment groups. We test this updating process

through visualizations and regression analysis.

Figure 2 and 3 display scatter plots of prior (X-axis) and posterior (Y-axis) beliefs in

1-year, 5-year and 10-year ahead horizon in Japan and the U.S.. Observations along the

red dashed horizontal lines represent respondents who updated their beliefs towards the

professional forecast, while those along the 45 degree line indicate respondents with no

change. Responses of 0% or 100% labor replacement ratio by GenAI, specifically those

with prior or posterior beliefs of 0 or 100, are excluded from the sample because they are

regarded as outliers in this analysis.

The longer the forecast horizon, the more likely individuals are to update their beliefs.

This suggests that as the uncertainty in personal responses increases, there is a greater

tendency to rely on expert forecasts. Another possible explanation is that respondents

interpret the professional forecasts as long-term estimates since the forecast do not mention

any specific timeline. As illustrated in Table B.3, regarding 1-year ahead beliefs, about 70%

of respondents in Japan and about 55% of respondents in the U.S. do not update their beliefs

at all. A large portion of the remaining respondents adjust their beliefs toward the expert

forecast—however, about 10% in Japan and 20% in the U.S. move in the opposite direction.

The share of respondents who do not change the projection of the job replacement ratio in

the 10-year forecast horizon is 59% in Japan and 46% in the U.S.

Another point worth mentioning is that the ratio of responses where the posterior is

greater than the prior is higher for the high treatment group than that for the low treatment

15

group. Put differently, respondents in the high treatment group are more likely to update

their belief about the replacement upward compared to those in the low treatment group.

For example, in Japan, 15.3% of respondents update their belief upward in the high

treatment group while 9.1% of those update their belief upward in the low treatment as

shown in Table B.3. The further into the future the belief pertains—such as five or ten
years ahead—the larger the difference between the treatment groups in the proportion

of respondents who update their beliefs upward. For the 10-year ahead horizon, 19% of

respondents in the high treatment group update their belief upward, while 9.5% of those

in the low treatment group do.

Finally, it is worth noting that the posterior beliefs do not exhibit increased variation

compared to the prior beliefs. In fact, the inter-quartile range and the standard deviations

remain relatively unchanged as seen in Table B.1. Moreover, this tendency holds true for

both treatment groups.

We quantify to what extent respondents update the expected job replacement ratio by
the difference in respondent’s posterior and prior
GenAI, regressing the updating (i.e.
expectations) on the shock, which is defined as the difference between the professional

forecast and the prior belief as follows:

Shocki =






47 − Priori

14 − Priori

if high replacementi

if high replacementi

= 1

= 0

(1)

In addition, we control for respondent’s prior belief to avoid mechanical correlation

between the updating and the shock. Specifically, we estimate the following equation

using OLS:

Updatingi

= β

+ β

1Shocki + β

2Priori + ΠXi + ϵi

0

(2)

where Xi is a set of control variables and ϵi is an idiosyncratic error. Xi includes age, age

squared, a dummy for females, log of income, a dummy for respondents with at least

18

a bachelor degree, a dummy for private use of generative AI, and dummies for having
subordinates, routine/repetitive worker, region, occupation, industry, and firm size.

The estimation result in Table 5 shows that if prior beliefs are lower by 1 percentage

point than professional forecasts—in other words, if the shock increases by 1 percentage

points—this would, on average, result in a 3 percentage point update in 1-year ahead

beliefs, a 7 percentage point update in 5-year beliefs, and a 10 percentage point update

in 10-year beliefs. As uncertainty rises in the more distant future, it becomes clear that

individuals rely more on professional forecast signals, resulting in a greater impact of

shocks. This result implies the respondents may follow Bayesian updating; respondents

who are less confident in their prior beliefs react more strongly to new signals.9 To test this,

we also include interaction terms with a dummy variable indicating whether respondents

are confident in their responses (see Table B.4 in Appendix B). The results show that for

some horizons, consistent with Bayesian updating, respondents who are confident in their

prior beliefs exhibit significantly lower updating.

9One of the explanations is that respondents believe the impact of AI on the labor market will materialize

in the long run and interpret the experts’ projections as long-term outlooks.

Notes: The table shows the OLS estimation results with Updating as a dependent variable. Updating is defined as the difference between
the posterior and prior belief about the job replacement ratio of labor by GenAI. The upper panel indicates the result for respondents in
Japan, and the lower panel for the U.S.. All specifications control for prior beliefs, age, age squared, a dummy for females, log income,
a dummy for respondents with at least a bachelor degree, a dummy for private use of GenAI, a dummy for having subordinates, a
dummy for routine/repetitive work, region, occupation, industry, and firm size. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. * denotes
significance at 10%, ** at 5%, and *** at 1%. level.

We also find that heterogeneities influence the updating. In the U.S., individuals who

privately use GenAI, with occupations in engineering, and with higher income levels tend
to update less compared to other cohorts. We do not find significant differences based on

other characteristics such as gender as seen in Table B.5.

One possible explanation for the differences in learning rules among individuals could

be that ones with private use of GenAI, with occupations in engineering, and with higher

income levels may have higher confidence in their prior beliefs. As shown in Table B.4, in

the U.S., higher educational groups tend to have higher confidence, cancelling the positive
effect of the shock on the updating while lower educational groups tends to prioritize new

information.

20

4.3 The causal effect of job replacement expectations on personal be-

haviors

In this section, we examine whether updating beliefs about job replacement due to GenAI

leads people to adjust their behavior. Specifically, we analyze whether the respondent’s
updatings affect their willingness to learn about and use GenAI in their workplace, referred

to as “GenAI learning intention ” and “GenAI use intention ,” respectively.

GenAI learning intention is defined as a binary variable based on the responses to the

question about learning opportunity as explained in Section 3.3. Similarly, GenAI use

intention is defined as a binary variable based on responses to the question about the

willingness to use GenAI in the workplace, as described in Section 3.3.

As illustrated in Figure C.2, Japan exhibits a higher share of respondents motivated

to use GenAI across both treatment groups.

In the higher job replacement treatment

group, 75% of Japanese respondents indicated they were motivated, compared to 70% in

the lower job replacement group. In contrast, 63% of respondents in the U.S. expressed

intention to use GenAI across both treatment arms, with a notable portion stating they had

”already used it in their workplace.” Notably, Japan demonstrates an increase in intention

in the higher job replacement group compared to the lower one. For learning intention

, the overall rate is lower, partly because many respondents indicated they had ”already

started learning.”

4.3.1 Empirical specification

We examine whether the updating of beliefs has an impact on GenAI learning intention and

GenAI use intention, with the assumption that these intentions follow a logit formation.
the difference between

Our main independent variable in the estimation is updating:

posterior and prior expectations. We exploit the exogenous variation created by the

random treatment assignment by instrumenting the updating of expectations through

equation (2). We also control for the people’s prior belief as a respondent’s shock is

correlated with one’s prior belief. To do so, we estimate the following equation using

variables including prior beliefs, age, age squared, a dummy for females, log of income,

a dummy for respondents with at least a bachelor degree, a dummy for private use of
generative AI, a dummy for having subordinates, a dummy for routine/repetitive work,

region, occupation, industry and firm size.

4.3.2 Marginal effects and results

Table 6 presents the marginal effects of updating beliefs as derived from the IV estimation.10

The results reveal that in Japan, belief updating significantly increases the intention to use
GenAI, while no statistically significant estimate of the marginal effect is observed in the

U.S. nor for GenAI learning intention.

When it comes to the willingness to learn GenAI, we do not find any statistically

significant estimates for the relationship between the updating and the willingness to learn

in either country. This may be attributable to the fact that many respondents have already

engaged in learning, coupled with a significant reduction in the number of observations

in the regression, which could have diminished the statistical power.

In Japan, a 1 percentage point update in beliefs with regard to the 1-year ahead job

replacement rate by GenAI increases the probability of answering “willing to use GenAI”

by 4.9 percentage points. Similarly, belief updates regarding the 5-year and 10-year ahead

replacement rates increase the intention to use GenAI by 2.2 percentage points and 1.4

10In this paper, we report a marginal effect at the mean, which is calculated by setting the values of all

covariates to their means in the sample.

22

percentage points, respectively.

One potential explanation for the stronger impact on usage intention in Japan is that,

as shown in Table A.2, the relatively low adoption rate of GenAI at 31% leaves more room

for individuals who perceive the risk of job replacement by GenAI to use the technology

as a means of reducing this risk. As in Table C.3, among respondents who answered
“motivated,” there is a difference between Japan and the U.S.: the proportion of those

using GenAI privately is low in Japan, whereas it is high in the U.S. People already using

GenAI in their workplace tend to use it privately in both Japan and the U.S.

4.4 The causal effect of job replacement expectations on macroeconomic

outlook and perceptions on respondents’ own jobs

4.4.1 Empirical specification

We examine how the posterior beliefs regarding GenAI replacement rates affect people’s

macroeconomic views. We employ the following variables to capture macroeconomic

expectations: wage growth, real GDP growth, CPI, and the growth rate of capital invest-

23

ment. Additionally, we incorporate outcome variables pertaining to respondents’ own

labor demand, productivity, and required skill levels.

For wage growth, real GDP growth, CPI, and the growth rate of capital investment,

respondents are asked to select specific expected values for the 1-year, and average 5- to

10-year horizons from a set of predefined options. We then scale each of these values

between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1 for analysis, so that the finite nature of

the minimum and maximum options is accounted for, allowing for consistent analysis of
differences in respondents’ selections across all variables.

For labor demand, productivity, and skills, we ask respondents to choose whether they

expect an “increase,” “decrease,” or “no change” rather than selecting specific numerical

values. We then standardize responses, with “decrease” set to a minimum value of 0 and

“increase” set to a maximum value of 1, scaling these responses in the same manner as the

other variables.

We assume these macroeconomic expectations are represented as a logistic function of

the posterior and control variables as follows,

Outcomei = exp(yi)
1 + exp(yi)

and

yi = γ

0

+ γ

1Posteriori + γ

2Priori + Π′

Xi + ei

(6)

(7)

where Outcome i is a scaled response of individual i for expectation about a macroeco-

nomic variable or respondent’s job. We should note that we did not ask questions about

expectations for macroeconomic variables at the 5-year horizon. Therefore, we use the
following three different sets of outcome and instrumental variables. The first set matches

expectations for the replacement ratio with macroeconomic outlooks 1 year ahead. The

second set pairs average macroeconomic expectations for 5 to 10 year ahead with job

replacement expectations 5 year ahead. Finally, the third set combines average macroe-

conomic expectations for 5- to 10 year ahead with job replacement expectations 10 year

ahead. Xi is a vector of the same control variables as in our previous estimations. The

24

variable of our interest is Posteriori and γ
However, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of γ
1 cannot be interpreted as a causal
effect. For example, people who are generally more optimistic may respond positively to

the question about the job replacement ratio, as well as to questions regarding expecta-

tions about macroeconomic outcomes. It is also conceivable that there may exist reverse

causality between posterior beliefs and macroeconomic expectations. To account for these

endogenity issues, we instrument our respondent’s posterior beliefs with the random as-
signment to the different forecasts regarding the job replacements by generative AI. In this

respect, we specify the following equation and estimate with two-stage least squares:

yi = γ

1High Replacementi

+ ˆβ

Xi + ei
2Priori + Θ′

Xi

(8)

(9)

where High Replacement indicates a dummy variable that takes the value of one if respon-

dent i is assigned to the treatment group for the high job replacement ratio. Since we

randomly assigned respondents to each group, the dummy variable provides exogenous

variation to the posterior belief. We refer to this specification as the baseline.

Actual differences in generative AI exposure across groups should affect the extent to

which people extrapolate from news about GenAI to their macroeconomic views. For
instance, since heterogeneous effects on updating exist (Table B.5), conceivably these dif-
ferences could lead to a difference in expectations about the macroeconomic outlooks.

Individuals who are aware of news or research suggesting that generative AI is likely to

replace jobs held by white-collar workers, or those working in related fields, may have

pessimistic views on the macroeconomic impact of AI. Then, such individuals, when in-

formed of a higher job replacement rate, may further reinforce their pessimistic view.

Likewise, older cohorts, who may perceive a higher risk of job displacement, might also

adopt a more pessimistic outlook.

We investigate heterogeneous effects based on age, gender, occupation, and education.
To examine heterogeneous effects on the expectations about macroeconomic outcomes, we

additionally interact the posterior belief with a dummy variable for heterogeneity as in

25

the following equation.

to a specific group based on the characteristic such as gender. Equations (12) and (13) are
estimated separately. The coefficients of interest are γ

1 and γ

2.

4.4.2 Marginal effects and results

While the details of the OLS and IV estimation results are provided in Tables D.2 and D.3
for reference, we focus on the marginal effects from the IV estimation in this section.

In Japan, the perceived job replacement ratio by GenAI has a marginally positive effect

on CPI as shown in Table 7. A one percentage point increase in posterior belief will increase

CPI by 0.26 percentage points 1 year ahead, by 0.17 percentage points 5 years ahead and
by 0.10 percentage points 10 years ahead. Among different occupations, those working

for “creative jobs” notably drive the overall inflation expectations through their updates

on the generative AI job replacement ratio, with increases of 0.59 percentage points 1 year

ahead, 0.25 percentage points 5 years ahead, and 0.19 percentage points 10 years ahead.

26

This positive effect on CPI may be attributed to expectations of increased demand for

AI-related investment, as reflected in private investment or GDP forecasts. Although the

average impact on private investment is positive, it is not statistically significant. However,
the estimated marginal effect is significantly positive for respondents in creative jobs,

indicating a 0.57 percentage point increase in 1 year. Regarding real GDP growth, while
the baseline estimates are not statistically significant, a positive effect of 0.27 percentage

points is observed for the high-income cohort.

While the job replacement ratio positively affects inflation expectation, it negatively
affects expectations about labor market indicators, such as labor demand. Table 8 shows

that the negative impact on labor demand is particularly pronounced among individuals

not using generative AI privately, with a decrease of 2.52 percentage points 5 years ahead

and 1.92 percentage points 10 years ahead. This implies that for those who do not use

GenAI privately, updating their job replacement ratios upward leads to the view of weaker

labor demand in the long term. Expectations for wage growth show weaker responses

compared to other economic indicators. The insignificant response of wages could be due
to two offsetting effects. On one hand, as Aldasoro et al. (2024) show, real wages may

increase as labor productivity rises with the use of AI as a copilot tool. On the other hand,

some segments of the labor force could be replaced by AI, reducing labor demand and

exerting downward pressure on wages. However, as we look further into the long-term
horizon, there is a discernible trend towards negative effects. This pattern parallels the

expectations for labor demand, suggesting a consistent and coherent response regarding

the anticipated impacts on the labor market.

In the U.S., beliefs about job replacement by GenAI do not have a causal relationship

with expectations for CPI as shown in Table 9. In addition, the estimates for private invest-

ment growth and real GDP growth are, on average, not statistically significant. However,
the job replacement ratio has negative effects on labor demand and required skill expecta-

tions as shown in Table 10. The labor demand indicator decreases by 3.4 percentage points

and required skill by 3.0 percentage points in the one-year horizon when the job replace-

ment ratio increases by one percentage point.11 This pessimism toward labor demand and

11Note that the labor demand indicator is constructed, based on the multiple choice responses, to take a

27

skills is particularly prevalent among more educated and older respondents. The impact

is economically significant; the expectation for labor demand among more educated re-

spondents declines by 8.3 percentage points and required skill by 9.1 percentage points in
one year ahead. The effect of the job replacement ratio on private investment also shows
heterogeneity, particularly across respondents with different educational backgrounds.

While respondents with lower educational attainment tend to have positive expectations,

those with higher education exhibit a more negative outlook. One possible explanation for
this difference is that respondents with higher educational levels in the U.S. expect gener-

ative AI to have a greater impact on their jobs, as a larger proportion of these respondents

recognize that GenAI has been adopted in their workplaces.12 The higher adoption rate of

GenAI among those with higher educational levels is largely due to the fact that they are

more likely to hold jobs that are relatively suited to the application of GenAI.

The negative impact of higher replacement risk on the labor demand outlook among

respondents in creative jobs may also be explained for similar reasons. Workers in creative

jobs have higher educational levels and are more likely to privately use GenAI, which

leads to more recognition of the potential of GenAI in their workplaces.13 In our survey,

75% of respondents in creative jobs use GenAI privately, compared to 52% of those in sales

& administrative and 68% of those in planning and professional jobs.

value between 0 and 1.

12In our survey, 87% of respondents with higher education reported that GenAI has been adopted in their
jobs, compared to 75% of those with lower educational levels. This pattern is consistent with other studies
including Cazzaniga et al. (2024).

13Previous studies including Haase and Hanel (2023) find that GenAI is especially useful for creative tasks

such as generating images.

5 Conclusion

We conduct a randomized experiment in which participants in the U.S. and Japan are
provided with two different assessments from professional forecasters regarding the ratio

of jobs replaced by GenAI. Using the exogenous variation, we investigate the causal impact

of job replacement expectations on macroeconomic expectations and individual behavioral

views.

We obtain the following findings. First, individuals in both countries adjust their

perceptions of the job replacement ratio by GenAI in response to the information provided

by professional forecasters. This adjustment is more pronounced as the time horizon

extends and uncertainty about the future increases.

Second, in Japan, higher post-treatment beliefs about the job replacement ratio lead

to higher inflation expectations. In addition, the belief in a higher job replacement ratio

leads to positive real GDP growth expectations, particularly among higher-income groups,
while this effect is not statistically significant on average. Furthermore, among individuals

in creative professions, an expectation of a higher job replacement ratio is causally related

to an increase in private investment growth. These findings imply that the demand for

investment in new industries spurred by generative AI could be a driver of the higher

inflation expectation. Moreover, respondents in Japan tend to show greater intention to

adopt generative AI in their workplaces as their beliefs about job replacement evolve.

On the other hand, in the U.S., higher expectations of job replacement are associated

with short-term reductions in labor demand and a decrease in the skills required for
existing jobs. This negative effect on labor demand expectations is more evident among

individuals with higher levels of education. This suggests that those with higher education

levels anticipate a stronger negative impact of GenAI on the labor market and their jobs,
aligning with previous studies that point to the varied impacts of GenAI on different labor

groups (e.g. Babina et al. (2023)).14

The differences observed between the U.S. and Japan may be tied to the level of public

14This result is also consistent with findings from the survey on economists’ predictions conducted by
Chicago Booth Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets (https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/ai-and-
the-labor-market/), which suggests that AI may have a negative impact on the earning potential of substantial
numbers of high-skilled workers in advanced economies.

discourse and familiarity with GenAI’s potential impact on the labor market. In Japan,

where the adoption rate of GenAI is lower and public awareness may be less developed,

there is a greater tendency to update beliefs, perceiving more potential for growth driven

by GenAI.

A growing number of studies analyze the role of news and public attention in the econ-

omy, particularly as social media increasingly permeates every aspect of our daily lives.

Opinions on AI’s impact vary widely—some are moderate, while others are extreme. Pol-

icymakers may sometimes dismiss extreme views as hype. However, even if these views

have an almost zero probability of coming to fruition, they can still influence individuals’

macroeconomic outlook and behavior. Further research on expectation formation and its

development is required for a better understanding of the economic impact.
